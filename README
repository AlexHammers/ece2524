The module reads in two command line arguments: a string and a number, and read input file from standard input.  If the string supplied on the command line is found anywhere on a line of input, then the grade on that line is changed to that number and the modified line printed to standard out.  Lines that do not match the string are printed back to standard out unchanged.
